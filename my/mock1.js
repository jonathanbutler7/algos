// mock interview:

// Surprised I didn’t ask input and output
// Practice script for technical interview:
// What’s input and output?
// Any edge cases I should be aware of?
// Valuable to ask if interviewer is concerned about formatting

// If given a fairly simple question, ask if there’s a second question or how much time do I have for this question?

// I spelled indices indeces

// Variable names are important. Need strongly typed language. Typescript for example. Valuable because strongly typed code…would never have hasTripleCharacters var name if it is an array. That sounds like a boolean name. 

// Interviewers don’t wanna be there, keep that in mind. Empathize w the fact that the person may not be 100% there. Empathy part is vital to consider. Understand the interviewer’s frame of mind.

// They have no reason to want you to fail. 

// Pseudo code is your friend. Write one line of pseudocode and then replace it with the code that you just described.

// If I’m not using the iterator I’m creating, I’m possibly doing something wrong.  

// Do you have experience with X? “No but I can learn”
// Not a great answer to this question. 
// Ask recruiter ‘hey I’d love to shore up on this, is there anything in particular I should be aware of’
